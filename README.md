# CSE509-Digital-Video-Processiong
Implemented Image Noising / De noising, Segmentation and Motion estimation as port of the course work CSE 509 Arizona State University

Part-1:
1. Gaussinan Pyramid construction
2. Laplacian Pyramind Construcction
3. Bilatrial Filtering of Image

Part-2:
1. Edge Detection using Soblel, Prewitt, Canny and Log Filters (with and without noise)
2. Contrast Enhancement using Adaptive gain Control, Histogram Equaliation and Adaptive histogram Equaliation methods.
3. Sharpness Enhancement using Unsharp Masking

Part-3
1. Image Denoising using Inverse filtering.
2. Image Denoising using Pseudo Inverse filtering.
3. Image Denoising using Constrained Least square filtering.

Part4:
( Will be updated on rolling basis till DEC 2023 :) )
